star_wars_character_catalogue
Dispatched to provide peace and justice to the galaxy I was.

Technologies stack & libraries used:
React
redux
redux-thunk for async actions
axios, HOC component for requests error handling
some CSS along with a few transitions (I was going to use CSSTransitions but I haven't used it for a while and didn't have much time to dig into it)
Tried to use InfiniteLoader Component, which kinda worked but I came across some issues and decided to leave it aside
CSS modules which did not really added any value in this project
I didn't use React hooks - I'm currently learning how to use them but I'm still much more comfortable with stateful class components and lifecycle methods

All depencies were added to the package.json

app should also scale properly on mobile devices (more less)
